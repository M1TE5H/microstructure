# tools

The `tools` of the `microstructure` framework include the following categories:
1. low-lying data structures for linear algebra, computational geometry, etc.
2. numerical algorithms e.g. differentiation, integration, interpolation
3. physical units

Individual `tools` can be linked to certain `utilities` as required.
